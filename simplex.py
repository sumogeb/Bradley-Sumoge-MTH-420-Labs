'''Lab 7: The Simplex Method'''
'''Name: Bradley Sumoge'''

'''1. What differences are there between the presentation in this lab and the 
    presentation of the method in Strang? In particular, which enhancements 
    improve convergence?
    
    The tableau is different when comparing the methods used in Strang and 
    this lab. The tableau matrix used in the lab seems to be very systematic 
    in calculating the optimal values of x. The format that it is presented in
    is overall different.'''
    
'''2. How many slack variables are there in the example given? How many basic 
    variables will there be?
    
    There are 3 slack variables in the example. In the end there should be 2
    basic variables.'''
    
'''3. Are there problems that Karmakar can solve faster?

    Yes. There isn't any one method that can perfectly come to a solution for 
    any function. The Simplex method has some solutions that it struggles to 
    get to, so the Karmakar method could be more beneficial in these 
    situations.'''
